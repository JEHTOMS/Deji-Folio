<h2>A Multidisciplinary designer crafting distinct and memorable brand presence by translating strategy into design.</h2>
<br/>
<h3>A Multi-disciplinary designer...</h3>
<p>It all began on a quiet summer afternoon in '17. As he delved into learning facial cartoon creation in Adobe Photoshop, his mom inquired about his summer plans, echoed by his brother. Responding initially with the intention to relax at home and watch movies, his mom insisted he acquire new skills. Graphic design was suggested by his brother, leading Deji to embark on a Corel Draw course, recommended by a church member. Surprisingly, he found joy in it, mastering Corel Draw, logo design principles, and exploring elements of editorial design like flyers and posters. Sharing his designs on Instagram, he received positive feedback and a paid opportunity to design initials for a friend's t-shirt, igniting his passion to pursue this path further.
Over the years, Deji honed his expertise in <strong> design, Brand strategy, Art direction, UI design, and Webflow development</strong>. This journey enabled him to acquire proficiency in softwares such as Adobe Illustrator (his primary tool), Photoshop, InDesign, Figma, and Webflow.</p>

<h3>Crafting distinct and memorable brand presence...</h3>
<p>Deji has embraced diverse roles as a freelancer, contractor, and full-time designer. These experiences have deepened his understanding about the principles of design, developing branding concepts and presentation of projects. Alongside technical skills, he has developed soft skills encompassing <em>collaboration, teamwork, attention to detail, communication, project management, innovative thinking, and design accessibility</em>. This versatile skill set allows him to successfully deliver projects and integrate seamlessly into teams. He thrives when working with companies that challenge conventional ideologies, embrace innovation, and redefine the status quo.</p>

<h3>Translating strategy into design...</h3>
<p>Deji strongly believes that any design project should begin by identifying the "why," the "who," and the "difference." This intentional approach ensures the design serves its intended audience. After which, he follows a <strong> process of research, creating moodboards, sketching ideas, designing, refining, and ultimately presentation</strong>. This methodology enables him to craft distinct and memorable presence for businesses in the minds of people.</p>

<h3>Hobbies...</h3>
<p>Outside of work, Deji indulges in reading books on psychology, sales, marketing, and finance. He stays up-to-date with design and startup trends through podcasts and articles. He loves experimenting on design ideologies and loves football as well.

<strong> Hopes to be part of something great and revolutionary someday</strong>.</p>
